# Minesweeper - Ghost Theme

This is a spooky-themed version of the classic Minesweeper game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a dark, eerie "ghost" theme, with animations for bomb reveals and a ghostly UI. 

I created this project for fun to give Minesweeper a unique and ghostly twist!

## Features

- **12x12 Grid**: The game board consists of a 12x12 grid with 15 bombs placed randomly.
- **Ghost Theme**: Dark background with spooky animations and a haunted interface.
- **Interactive UI**: Click to reveal cells and right-click to flag them. The bomb icon shakes when revealed.
- **Game Over**: If you click on a bomb, the game ends and displays a game-over message.
- **Restart**: You can restart the game at any time by clicking the restart button.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/roopeshach/minesweeper-fun.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## How to Play

1. Click on any cell to reveal it.
2. Right-click to flag a cell you suspect contains a bomb.
3. If you click on a bomb, the game ends, and the bomb icon will be revealed.
4. The game board will show the number of adjacent bombs around each revealed cell.
5. Restart the game by clicking the restart button.
